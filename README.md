## Motivation

This is a project that shows proficiencies with the tech that is needed at Clockwork

This starter uses following libraries:

- Vite
- React
  - React Router
  - Redux
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
  - AmplifyUI
- ESLint
- Prettier

## Set up

```shell
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Formatter and Linter

Already set up [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). You can customize the rules.

NOTICE: The template does not use [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) and [prettier-eslint](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint). So I recommend that running commands individually. e.g. `prettier && eslint`.

Please read: https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html.
